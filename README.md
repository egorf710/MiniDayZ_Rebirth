# MiniDayZ_Rebirth
 
Hi. This is the latest demo version of the project, the next version is a release where a lot of things have changed, the interface, game mechanics, etc. Now I can't continue to develop the game because I entered the IT direction, in a place where the first month will be the course of a young fighter, and for security reasons it is impossible to use gadgets there. Sorry about what happened. The game is still raw and with bugs.

The repository of the new version of the project, tried without the shitcode. The repository will be updated from October 23
